# quicksort
Repeatedly partitions the input into low and high parts, and then recursively sorts each of those parts.  
To partition the input, quicksort chooses a pivot to divide the data into low and high parts.  
The pivot can be any value within the array being sorted, commonly the value of the middle array element.
